# Some Surprising Results in Linear Regression

While collaborating with a colleague on a paper in _Data Mining_, I found some interesting and surprising results in that old horse of statistics, _Linear Regression Analysis_.

I donâ€™t know whether or not those results are original, but they are sufficiently interesting to deserve a short technical document of their own.

Incidentally, the results derived in this essay form the basis for the algorithm behind a java application I wrote illustrating how online linear regression can be done efficiently.
